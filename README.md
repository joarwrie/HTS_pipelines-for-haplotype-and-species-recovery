# HTS pipelines for haplotype and species recovery
Bioinformatics pipelines used for processing data from HTS of amplicon for both taxonomic and haplotypic diversity assessments

These pipelines were used in the article “High-Throughput Sequencing on preservative ethanol is effective at jointly examining infra-specific and taxonomic diversity, although bioinformatics pipelines do not perform equally.” by Marjorie Couton, Aurélien Baud, Claire Daguin-Thiébaut, Erwan Corre, Thierry Comtet & Frédérique Viard, published in Ecology and Evolution. DOI: https://doi.org/10.1002/ece3.7453

For each pipeline, the file named "File_to_run.sh" can be used to run the pipeline providing that all the other files in the directory are also present. Raw data on which these pipeline were used are stored as SRA in ncbi under the BioProject IDs: PRJNA639923 and PRJNA639681.
